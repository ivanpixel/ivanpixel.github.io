                <h3>Treating Injuries</h3>
                <p>In the event of a box jellyfish sting, prompt and appropriate treatment is essential to alleviate symptoms and prevent complications. If a guest is stung, it's crucial to remain calm and immediately remove them from the water to prevent further exposure to the jellyfish's tentacles. Do not rub the affected area or rinse it with freshwater, as this can activate additional nematocysts and exacerbate the sting. Instead, rinse the area with vinegar to neutralize the venom and deactivate any remaining nematocysts. If vinegar is not available, seawater can be used as an alternative. Avoid using freshwater, alcohol, or urine, as these can worsen the sting. After rinsing with vinegar or seawater, carefully remove any tentacles remaining on the skin using tweezers or gloves to avoid contact with the venom. Once the tentacles are removed, immerse the affected area in hot water (approximately 45 degrees Celsius or 113 degrees Fahrenheit) for 20 to 45 minutes to help alleviate pain and neutralize the venom. Monitor the individual closely for signs of an allergic reaction or severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or loss of consciousness. If these symptoms occur, seek emergency medical assistance immediately. Even if symptoms appear mild, it's advisable to seek medical evaluation to ensure proper treatment and monitoring.</p>

                <h3>Preventative Measures</h3>
                <p>Awareness and precautionary steps can significantly reduce the likelihood of stings and associated injuries. Firstly, guests are advised to swim only in designated areas supervised by lifeguards, as these areas are regularly monitored for jellyfish activity. Additionally, wearing protective clothing such as rash guards or wetsuits can provide a physical barrier against jellyfish tentacles. When swimming or snorkeling, avoid areas where jellyfish are known to inhabit, such as near river mouths, harbors, or areas with dense vegetation. It's also advisable to swim during daylight hours when jellyfish are more visible and avoid swimming during peak jellyfish season or after heavy rainfall, as these conditions can increase jellyfish activity. Before entering the water, guests should familiarize themselves with warning signs posted by lifeguards or resort staff regarding jellyfish sightings or beach closures. If jellyfish are present, heed these warnings and refrain from entering the water until it is deemed safe to do so. When walking along the beach, be cautious of washed-up jellyfish or tentacles and avoid touching them. Educating guests about the dangers of box jellyfish and providing information on preventative measures through signage, orientation sessions, or informational materials can further enhance safety awareness.</p>
